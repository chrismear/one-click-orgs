# One click organisations

One Click Orgs is building a website where groups can quickly create a legal structure and get a simple system for group decisions. We think social enterprises, collectives and activist groups have better things to think about than obscure legal clauses.

The One Click Orgs platform will give you:

 * A constitution written in plain english
 * An official legal structure so your group can open a bank account
 * A list of group members that's automatically kept up to date
 * A voting system to help make group decisions
 * A record of every decision that's been made
 * Easy ways to modify the constitution as your group develops

Right now we're busy building the system and testing it out with the first few groups. If your group is interested in using One Click Orgs please contact us and we'll let you know when it's ready.
