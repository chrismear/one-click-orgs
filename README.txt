Bootstrap a One Click Orgs development environment.

1. Install VirtualBox (version 4.0.x).
2. Install Ruby (1.9.2 or 1.8.7, doesn't really matter since we're only using it to bootstrap your environment).
3. Download bootstrap.rb to a new directory.
4. From the new directory run:
       ruby bootstrap.rb
